    <!-- In the 'header', I added 'nav' tags and then I nested an unordered list inside linking two different pages which are 'Home' and 'Services' this will allow for the user to navigate between the different sections. -->

        </nav>
    </header>
    <!-- Right under the 'header' I placed some headings aswell as some text to go along with the headings. The first heading was 'Jedds Tree Care Services' which is set to the first level heading, which is the largest. To go along with that, an image was added with that heading to go along with it. Right under that, I then proceeded to add eight different heading titles set the second level which are smaller than the first level. Under those heading, I placed some basic information of their services for the given heading and wrapped them in 'p' tags. After all of those I placed a footer with information of their address.  -->

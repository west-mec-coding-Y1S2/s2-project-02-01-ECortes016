    <!-- In the 'aside', I added an image that shows up as 'Comments', I then proceeded to place reviews from customers into 'blockquotes' which will then make them look better than just normal text. I then added special characters '&#8212;' to make the â€” which then gave the name of the reviewer some style. I did this for three different reviews.  -->

            <p>I hired Jedds to remove an old Sugar maple from a narrow yard. They did the job with no damage to my garage and
                cleaned it all up that same day. Great service.</p>

            <p>Jedds Tree Care promptly came to examine a downed tree and provide an estimate for its removal. They did the
                job fast and at the lowest bid. I'll call them again without hesitation for future lawn and garden needs.</p>

            <p>Their team took down five trees in one day and did an immaculate clean-up. They took extra care not to disturb
                my lawn and garden. I highly recommend their service.</p>

    <!-- In the 'article', I added the basic information of the company in paragraphs. After finishing up those, I made an 'address' tag and inside I added all the contact information which would be needed in order to contact the company. The email was wrapped around in an 'a' tag which allows the user to click on it and it will send them to their email browser. The same goes for the telephone number but once you click on it, it would prompt you to call it. -->
